        <h1>Colten Brant </h1>
        <p> I am 13 yrs old </p>
        <p> I love playing with tech.</p>
        <h3>Some of my favorite things to do are:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Have AI vibe code apps for me</li>
          <li>3d print fun stuff on my A1 mini</li>
          <li>Work on PCB design (kinda, I lost courage after one of my projects blew up)</li>
          <li>Play/mess with linux</li>
        </ul>
        <p> My favorite linux distros are Fedora and Ubuntu (mostly fedora though).</p>

        <h3>My favorite desktops for linux are:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sway Tiling WM</strong> (I think it is kinda fun and something different from the usual desktop)</li>
          <li><strong>KDE Plasma</strong> (I like the similarities to windows and the extreme out of box customizability, but sometimes I want something more adventurous.)</li>
          <li><strong>GNOME</strong>(This one has really grown on me, but I like it with the right tweaks,<br>like Dash to Panel with GNOME topbar kept, and Arc Menu)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Some of my goals for when I have time are:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn Python (and maybe Ruby too).</li>
          <li>Try to sell some of my designs on Tindie.(maybe if I have a good idea, but probably not.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Some of my current/finished projects are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Electromagnetic Levitator</strong> (already designed and have all the parts, sometime I will build and tune it)
                <p>(if it works out, It will make a strong N52 magnet float<br>using a custom active attractive electromagnet system)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>WLEDnano (WIP)</strong>
                <p>This tiny little board can run WLED using the ESP32-S3-MINI-1 chipset<br>and control up to 2 sets addressable 5V LEDs (*it technically has 2 data pins, but you would probably run out of power with 2,<br>but there might not be enough to run 1 strip (depending on strip length)) while being the size of your thumb<br>and being able to power it with the included USB-C port. (hopefully, but probably not enough power to run bigger strips (ex. matrixes))</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>D1 mini WLED shield</strong>
              <p>This was the project that i spent weeks working and waiting, and then when I built it and plugged it in, it blew a tantalum capacitor and blew burn holes into my rug.<br>
              The specs it was supposed to have was a ESP32 D1 mini running WLED, on a custom shield that had a LM2596-5.0 buck converter circuitry<br>(probably where I went wrong, because they are complex, and I had a ton of bugs in my design),<br>A fuse (put on the 5V line by accident, not the 12V line in), A level shifter for data stability,<br>and a spot to plug in a MAX9814 module with a gain jumper for audioreactive WLED,<br>and 2 terminal blocks for hookup (turns out I used the wrong footprint, so they didn't fit).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
